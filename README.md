# Task Management Application

This is a Task Management Application where users can manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and reordering tasks with a drag-and-drop interface. The tasks are categorized into To-Do, In Progress, and Done. Users can also set due dates for tasks, and the app features dark mode, color indicators for overdue tasks, and a simple activity log to track changes.
